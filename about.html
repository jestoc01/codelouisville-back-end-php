			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
			The founders of Guardian Medication Systems have had extensive experience as practitioners in the fields of pharmacy, pain management, home healthcare, and addiction medicine. 
			We've directly observed the difficulties pain patients, recovering substance use disorder patients, healthcare providers, law enforcement, and pharmacists share in trying to balance the treatment of pain and addiction with the prevention of abuse, misuse and diversion of medications.

			<h3>Our Passion</h3>
			<p>
			Our passion is to improve the devices and methods currently available to help patients get the care they need. This involves ensuring patients get the right dose of medication at the right time. New monitoring methods are especially important with those patients taking controlled substances. Right now there is no way to avoid deception on pill counts and urine drug screens. Our work addresses these problems.
